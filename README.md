# DraftMoodMod

Recognize your colonists' combat skills! This mod introduces mood buffs for pawns who excel in fighting.

When a pawn reaches a certain skill level in either Shooting or Melee, they will receive a mood boost. This is to reflect their proficiency and confidence in combat.

- Pawns with Shooting or Melee skills above the 'Skilled' threshold gain a moderate mood boost.
- Pawns with Shooting or Melee skills above the 'Master' threshold gain a significant mood boost.

These thresholds are set to default values of 7 for Skilled and 15 for Master. Both the skill thresholds and the mood bonus amounts (default: +3 for Skilled, +7 for Master) can be easily customized through the Mod Settings menu to fit your desired game balance.

It is compatible with other mods and does not require any additional dependencies. Enjoy your time in RimWorld!
